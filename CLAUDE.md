# modular-skills

A rule registry and generator for AI-agent config, checked into the *project*
it configures. One team, one committed source of truth: run the generator, get
`CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/` files every developer on the repo shares.

Not a personal `~/.claude` setup. Not a skill bundle. The unit of reuse is the
project, not the developer.

## The model is eslint's

- a **registry** of small, named, independently-addressable rules
- a **shareable base config** a project extends
- each rule **on or off** per project
- each rule **tunable** (options), because "which" is rarely the whole answer
- projects **add their own** rules that ship with nobody else's
- config is **committed**, so the team evolves it in review like any other code

Teams don't adopt a ruleset, they negotiate one. The config file is where that
negotiation lives.

## Prior art

`docs/ai-rulesmith-review.md` — teardown of the closest existing thing. Take
its rule file format, slug namespace, `vars` substitution and target adapters;
it has no `extends` and no disable, which is the half that matters here.

`docs/HANDOFF.md` — earlier conversation. Its research on Claude Code's native
`.claude/rules/` mechanism stands; its conclusion (personal ruleset symlinked
into `~/.claude/`) was the wrong problem.

## Status

Design. Nothing implemented.
